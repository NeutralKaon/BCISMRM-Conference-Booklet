# BCISMRM-Conference-Booklet

I recently found myself on the organising committee for a scientific conference, and wanted to create a programme book incorporating "camera ready" abstract PDFs that others would submit, together with full-page advertisments from sponsors, and yet incorporate them into a good-looking booklet. 

This memoir document is that booklet, with some large files hosted elsewhere because of github's limitations. 

Some interesting points: 
1. Abstracts are included programmatically from a google form with includepdf. A macro keeps the abstract number on the outside of the page. Page numbers and the presentation section are placed lovingly by memoir at the top of the page, in keeping with the existing page style. 
2. Abstract author tables are also programmatically generated by a simple bash script from existing registration data and then included in the relevant section
3. I include a blank cover/back image as the printers requested the cover image separately for the (perfect bound) book. 


I hope that this is remotely useful to someone else, somewhere, at some point in the future.
