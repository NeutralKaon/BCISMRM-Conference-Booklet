\chapter{Welcome}
On behalf of the local organising committee, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 24\textsuperscript{th} annual scientific meeting of the British Chapter of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and to the beautiful city of Oxford.  It has been great fun bringing together what we hope will be an interesting, exciting and forward looking programme. The local organising committee were in complete agreement that we wanted the meeting to be a real celebration of ``the next generation of MRI'' – both in terms of the next generation of technology and developments but also the next generation of amazing scientists presenting their work. With 36 oral presentations, 24 power pitches and 29 poster presentations it will hopefully be a meeting packed with great science. Add on top of that, some amazing invited speakers and the wonderful Joe Ackerman delivering the Bill Moore Lecture -- we should have a feast of fascinating ideas to talk about. However, it shouldn't be all work, work, work! With a murder mystery themed treasure trail around the dreaming spires, an early morning park run and a gala dinner at the delightful Somerville College -- there should be something for everyone to enjoy.\\


Welcome again, we hope you enjoy the meeting and visiting Oxford -- if you have any questions or problems – just stop one of the local organising committee -- they will be happy to try and help.\\

 
Best,\\[2em]

\chapter{Information}
\vspace{-5em}
\section*{Boring but important}
We do not expect routine fire alarm tests in any of the venues during the conference, so please leave should it sound (as a continuous, loud tone) by the nearest available exit.

Regarding wireless internet access, \textbf{if you have access to eduroam} then \textbf{please use it!} It's accessible in most places in the city, including all the conference venues. We have a \emph{limited} number of guest accounts for the unencrypted wireless network OWL -- please contact a member of the committee if you require one.

Regarding dietary requirements, the catering staff at all venues have been informed ahead of time about the requirements of those attending. If that applies to you, please just have a friendly chat with them and make your requirements known. 


Do not hesitate to get in touch with the local organising committee with literally any questions about anything that you may have --- we are all more than happy to help (or just to chat!)

\section*{Johanna Vannesjo, University of Oxford}
\begin{wrapfigure}{O}{\SpeakerSize}
\includegraphics[width=\SpeakerSize]{SpeakerPics/image11}	
\end{wrapfigure}
 Dr Johanna Vannesjo's research is focused on two main areas of interest. One topic is to develop methods for functional MRI of the spinal cord at ultra-high field. This poses a number of technical challenges related to spinal cord anatomy. As it is a small structure, high resolution imaging is required to resolve fine details, and the image quality is often compromised by local magnetic field distortions and dynamic field fluctuations due to its close proximity to the thorax. This connects to the second major topic of my research - improving static and dynamic field fidelity in the MR scanner. To address static field distortions and physiological field fluctuations I work on a technique called dynamic shimming. This requires dynamic waveform control of the shim fields, such as is normally used for gradient fields in MRI. Neither gradient nor shim field dynamics is perfect, however. I further investigate methods to correct for dynamic field deviations using NMR-based magnetic field sensors to measure the dynamic characteristics of the gradient and shim fields.
